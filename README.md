# MountainCar-using-qlearning

Problem description : 
A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.
